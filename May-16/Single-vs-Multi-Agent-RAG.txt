Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent RAG: Comparative Note

1. Definition:
- Single-Agent RAG:
  A single model (agent) retrieves relevant documents and generates responses. Both retrieval and generation tasks are handled by the same agent or a tightly integrated pipeline.
  
- Multi-Agent RAG:
  Multiple specialized agents collaborate for retrieval and generation. Some agents focus on retrieving domain-specific knowledge, others focus on reasoning, summarization, or final response generation.

2. Architecture:
- Single-Agent:
  Simple architecture with one retriever-generator loop.
  
- Multi-Agent:
  Modular architecture with specialized agents communicating through prompts, APIs, or orchestration frameworks.

3. Advantages:
- Single-Agent:
  - Simpler to implement and deploy.
  - Lower computational overhead.
  - Easier to fine-tune as a single pipeline.
  
- Multi-Agent:
  - Better handling of complex queries through specialization.
  - Scalable with domain-specific knowledge.
  - More interpretable (transparent steps of reasoning).

4. Use Cases:
- Single-Agent:
  - General-purpose chatbots.
  - FAQ answering systems.
  - Simple document Q&A.
  
- Multi-Agent:
  - Enterprise search across multiple domains.
  - Scientific research assistance.
  - Complex multi-step reasoning tasks.

5. Limitations:
- Single-Agent:
  - Struggles with multi-domain or highly specialized queries.
  - Limited scalability for diverse knowledge bases.
  
- Multi-Agent:
  - Higher system complexity.
  - Requires robust coordination and prompt design.
  - Increased latency.

6. Example Tools/Frameworks:
- Single-Agent:
  - LangChain (basic RAG setups).
  - OpenAI Assistants API (single retrieval/generation loop).
  
- Multi-Agent:
  - AutoGPT, CrewAI (multi-agent orchestration).
  - LangGraph for complex agent workflows.
