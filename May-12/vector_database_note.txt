A vector database is a type of database that is designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vector embeddings.
These vector embeddings are numerical representations of data objects such as text, images, audio, or video.
They are generated using machine learning models to capture the semantic meaning or key features of the objects.
Unlike traditional databases that manage structured data (like rows and columns), vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations.
Similarity searches in vector databases often use distance metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or inner product.
These searches aim to find vectors that are most similar to a given query vector, enabling tasks like nearest neighbor search.
Vector databases are crucial in applications like recommendation systems, semantic search engines, image recognition, and anomaly detection.
Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, and FAISS.
These databases often support approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
Vector databases can handle billions of vectors and support real-time or batch processing scenarios.
They also offer capabilities like indexing, sharding, replication, and integration with existing data pipelines.
Vector databases can be used standalone or in combination with other databases and search engines.
They enable use cases such as finding similar documents, matching users with products, and detecting patterns in large datasets.
The rise of large language models (LLMs) and AI applications has fueled the demand for vector databases.
By storing and querying vector embeddings, organizations can enhance AI-powered search and retrieval functionalities.
These databases play a key role in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where vectors are used to retrieve relevant context for generative models.
